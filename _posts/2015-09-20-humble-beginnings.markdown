Do you remember a time in your early childhood when you questioned everything? That which we now take for granted was once a mixed up puzzle, which over time we pieced together to form our own unique view of the world around us.
Well the world changes, and so must our views to evolve our representations of it. We learn to collaborate on ideas, forming thoughts leading to opinions which we go on to share with others to either affirm or question our understanding.
In the modern world we are reliant on data above assumptions - the world is no longer flat. For almost everything we ask there is likely an answer in data. How many times has someone suggested 'googling it'?
The point I aim to make throughout this personal journal being there is potentially an answer for any question in data somewhere, and our ability to access it is more pervasive with each passing day yet the most insightful answers require the right questioning.
We need to keep challenging ourselves to search for the question or key word that leads us to the most informed result. Reaching an answer sooner than ever thought possible a decade ago is now a society norm, yet the question that leads to that answer should also be reviewed to ensure the implied results compliment that asked by others in our social network; my version of the truth differs to yours, though both may still be valid in their contexts.
